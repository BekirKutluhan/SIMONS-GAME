## My process

My first goal was understand how SIMON GAME is played and how i could program javascript code for this.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge is educational for JQUERY,DOM,JavaScript.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<!-- COL-CIRCLE -->
<div class="col-lg-4 ">
  <i class="fas fa-bullseye  color-red fa-4x"></i><br>
  <h3 class="Mont">Elite Clientele</h3>
  <p id="paragraphs1">We have all the dogs, the <br>greatest dogs.</p>
</div>
 ```CSS
 @media screen and (max-width:900px){
   #tindogimg{
     margin-top: 50px;
     width: 30%;
     transform: rotate(0);
   }
 #title{
     background-color: #ff4c68;
   }
```



### Continued development

I still need to learn a lot. Please contact me if you think i did something wrong or weak or mine is worse than yours.
